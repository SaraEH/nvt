  script_tag(name: "insight", value: "Git is a distributed revision control
  system with a decentralized architecture. As opposed to centralized version
  control systems with a client-server model, Git ensures that each working copy
  of a Git repository is an exact copy with complete revision history. This not
  only allows the user to work on and contribute to projects without the need to
  have permission to push the changes to their official repositories, but also
  makes it possible for the user to work with no network connection.

A flaw was found in the way the git-remote-ext helper processed certain
URLs. If a user had Git configured to automatically clone submodules from
untrusted repositories, an attacker could inject commands into the URL of a
submodule, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the user's system.
(BZ#1269794)

All git users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
